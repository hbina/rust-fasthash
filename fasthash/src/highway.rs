//! ## HighwayHash
//!
//! We have devised a new way of mixing inputs with SIMD multiply and permute
//! instructions. The multiplications are 32x32 -> 64 bits and therefore infeasible
//! to reverse. Permuting equalizes the distribution of the resulting bytes.
//!
//! The internal state is quite large (1024 bits) but fits within SIMD registers.
//! Due to limitations of the AVX2 instruction set, the registers are partitioned
//! into two 512-bit halves that remain independent until the reduce phase. The
//! algorithm outputs 64 bit digests or up to 256 bits at no extra cost.
//!
//! In addition to high throughput, the algorithm is designed for low finalization
//! cost. The result is more than twice as fast as SipTreeHash.
//!
//! We also provide an SSE4.1 version (80% as fast for large inputs and 95% as fast
//! for short inputs), an implementation for VSX on POWER and a portable version
//! (10% as fast). A third-party ARM implementation is referenced below.
//!
//! Statistical analyses and preliminary cryptanalysis are given in
//! <https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06257>.
